# THGNCDA
## Introduction
THGNCDA is a method used to predict the association between circRNAs and diseases. It introduces miRNA as mediator and construct a triple-heterogeneous graph network to bring more information to circRNA-disease association prediction. Two feature embedding methods are constructed from the triple-heterogeneous graph network. Finally, the two set of feature embeddings were put into the enhanced graph attention neural network and the enhanced convolutional neural network respectively which including three attention mechanisms to fully extract features and make the prediction between circRNA and disease.

## Usage
You can download the code and replace the data path with your own data to run it. Note that the data needs to be organized as our paper described.
